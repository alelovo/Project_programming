This is a project for my final programming exam.
I analyzed the Billboard Hot 100 dataset which takes into consideration attributes of the songs that are present in the chart. 
The songs and attributes detected come from Spotify.

Dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/billboard-hot-100-audio-features 

The main things carried out in the project are:

- Explore the dataset

- Clean up the dataset

- Show some interesting plots

- Find two model: Cluster model using kMeans, Random forest classifier to predict maingenre

- Build a presentation in streamlit
