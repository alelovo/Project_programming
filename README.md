# Project_programming

![image](billhot100.png)

This is a project for my final programming exam.
I analyzed the Billboard Hot 100 dataset which takes into consideration attributes of the songs that are present in the chart. 
The songs and attributes detected come from Spotify.

Dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/billboard-hot-100-audio-features 

The main things carried out in the project are:

- Explore the dataset

- Clean up the dataset

- Show some interesting plots

- Find two model: Cluster model using kMeans, Random forest classifier to predict maingenre

- Build a presentation in streamlit

-------------------------------------------

How to navigate through the files in this repository:

* 'project.ipynb': it is the file where all my work is present, including unused graphs and models (this file is not perfectly ordered from a content point of view), I created a file that summarizes and explains my path which I called 'best of my project'.

* 'presentation_sl.py': where there is the code relating to the presentation on streamlit.

* 'Best of my project': Where I have arranged and explained the code, where what I consider most important about my project is contained (I suggest viewing this).
